4. Known issues
---------------

a. LifeNet requires the Wifi network adapters to function in ad-hoc mode. It may be possible that your machine uses proprietary drivers for Wifi network adapters that do not support adhoc functionality. In that case, LifeNet will not function on your machine. LifeNet has been successfully tested with the following WiFi network drivers:
- iwl family like iwl3945
- madwifi

b. LifeNet does not support 64-bit operating systems. Support for the same will be available in subsequent releases.
