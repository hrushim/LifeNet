2. Compatibility
----------------

LifeNet supports and has been fully tested on the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu Linux distributions including and after 8.04
*NOTE: We have not tested Lifenet on latest Ubuntu versions running a 3.0+ kernel.

- Kubuntu Linux distributions including and after 8.04
*NOTE: We have not tested Lifenet on latest Kubuntu versions running a 3.0+ kernel.

LifeNet can also work on other Linux distributions. However, the developers haven't yet fully tested LifeNet onto Linux distros other than those mentioned above. Please feel free to try it out on other Linux distributions that you may have and email your feedback to any of the following with 'LifeNet feedback' as your email subject:
- hrushi@gatech.edu
- ashwin.p@gatech.edu
- vempala@cc.gatech.edu

3. Installation guide
---------------------

You need to know the following information before you start the installation:
a. Name of your Wifi network interface
b. Name of your Ethernet network interface

[Step 1 - Configuration]
------------------------

	Command -> $sudo ./configure

[Step 2 - Compilation]
----------------------

	Command -> $sudo ./compile


    OPTIONAL:
	Command -> $sudo ./compile_optional_apps

[Step 3 - Installation]
-----------------------

	Command -> $sudo ./install


    OPTIONAL:
	Command -> $sudo ./install_optional_apps

[Step 4 - LifeNet commands]

Once the above mentioned 3 steps are successfully executed, you can use the following commands: 

[Starting LifeNet]
	Command -> $lifenet_start

[Stopping Lifenet]
	Command -> $lifenet_stop


OPTIONAL:
[Starting Network Visualization]
	Command -> $lifenet_visualize

[Starting LifeNet Communicator]
	Command -> $lifenet_chat

[Starting File Transfer Client]

4. Known issues
---------------

a. LifeNet requires the Wifi network adapters to function in ad-hoc mode. It may be possible that your machine uses proprietary drivers for Wifi network adapters that do not support adhoc functionality. In that case, LifeNet will not function on your machine. LifeNet has been successfully tested with the following WiFi network drivers:
- iwl family like iwl3945
- madwifi
